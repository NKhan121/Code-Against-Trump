# Code Against Trump

Post-election there's been a groundswell of data + tech people curious to use their skills to work against Trump's America. There have also been a number of new groups emerging to do just that. It's been a little hard to keep track. This is a list of volunteer-based groups that use data and technology to improve American communities and work against Trump's vision of America.

## An Important Note
Data and technology is but one part of a very large toolbox in fighting back. Please check out websites like [Holy Fuck. Now What?](http://www.holyfucktheelection.com/) and [political-resources](https://valeriecodes.github.io/political-resources/) on other ways to volunteer time or money (and help grow [each](https://github.com/csb324/holyfucktheelectionistomorrow) [list](https://github.com/valeriecodes/political-resources), respectively). Many of the groups below are predominantly focused on data and tech but invite people from all skillsets and levels of expertise.
